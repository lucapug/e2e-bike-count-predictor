# e2e-bike-count-predictor

A bike-sharing prediction service is a useful tool to plan daily supply of bikes. The main goal is to create an end to end service with the main characteristics required in a production environment: possibility of monitoring in production with possible consequent refinement of the prediction model, reproducibility of the entire workflow, quality checks and automation.

## Problem Description

### Overview

The problem is assisting a bike-sharing activity in taking decisions about the supply of bikes over time, to promptly react to demand fluctuations. The specific objective is to predict the hourly count of rented bikes. For this project, the predictions are based on historical data from the bike-sharing system of the city of Seoul, in South Korea. Ddareungi (Seoul Bike) is Seoul, South Koreaâ€™s bike-sharing system. Ddareungi started as a leisure activity but has transformed into a popular means of transportation. This will be treated as a regression problem.

### Data Source

There is a dataset originally extracted from the official Seoul Open Data Plaza and that was already used in scientific research activities (see references). It is publicly available in the <strong>UCI machine learning Repository</strong>:

*Seoul Bike Sharing Demand. (2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository.* [https://doi.org/10.24432/C5F62R](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5F62R).

### Dataset description

It is a tabular dataset, comprising **8760 rows** and <strong>14 columns</strong>. Here below the name and short explanation of each column (variable):

* Date : year-month-day
* Rented Bike count : Count of bikes rented at each hour
* Hour : Hour of he day
* Temperature : Temperature in Celsius
* Humidity : %
* Windspeed : m/s
* Visibility : 10m
* Dew point temperature : Temperature in Celsius
* Solar radiation : MJ/m2
* Rainfall : mm
* Snowfall : cm
* Seasons : Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn
* Holiday : Holiday/No holiday
* Functional Day : NoFunc(Non Functional Hours), Fun(Functional hours)

The data stored in a row are values for a fixed hour of the day. The dataset spans from December, 1, 2017 to November, 30, 2018. The **Rented Bike count** is the target variable in this problem.

## Preparing the Dev Environment

The whole development has been done in an isolated virtual environment. I have chosen [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as Python dependency manager. For better reproducibility, all the employed libraries are recorded with pinned versions. Among the best coding practices adopted are the usage of linters, formatters and pre-commit hooks

## Preparing the Dataset files (prepare\_data.ipynb)

I have held out part of the dataset in order to simulate a monitoring task during the deployment in production. In particular, from the total 8760 samples, I have stored 6576 samples from Winter, Spring and Summer in `ref_data.csv` and the remaining 2184 samples (Autumn) have been stored in `curr_data.csv`.
To simulate weekly data monitoring, the curr\_data samples have been divided into 13 batches (each batch containing 24x7=168 samples), and each batch was saved to a csv file (`curr_data_week01.csv`, ``` curr_data_week02``.csv ```, ..., `reserved_12.csv`).
